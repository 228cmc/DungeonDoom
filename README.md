Classes and object-oriented design

the game applies object-oriented programming principles by organizing functionality into specific classes such as :  wall, gold, wall, player, HumanPlayer, Botplayer, Board. 
the player class is an abstract base class that defines shared attributes like position (x, y) and collected gold. both humanplayer and botplayer inherit from it, using inheritance to share common methods like movement while implementing their unique behaviors/ specialization. For example the botplayer includes the chasehuman method to track the human player.

the board class encapsulates the gameâ€™s logic, managing interactions between players, walls, exits, and gold. it processes commands like move + direction or pickup and updates the board state. the gold class includes a static requiredgold method, ensuring the game enforces a fixed win condition, showcasing encapsulation of data and behavior.

the emptyfloor class validates the board dimensions and layout, keeping validation logic isolated.
